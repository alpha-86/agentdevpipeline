- No work may skip the defined gates.
- Overdue reviews must be escalated rather than ignored.
- Every active work item must map to an issue id and current gate.
- If context is lost, recover issue state and latest gate decision before execution.
- Every review or meeting must load the corresponding workflow before it starts.
- Issue comments should contain structured summary and links, not pasted long-form design bodies.
- Implementation completion must trigger QA rather than waiting for manual follow-up.
