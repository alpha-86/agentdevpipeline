# create-agent

Supported types:

- team-lead
- product-manager
- architect
- engineer
- qa-engineer
- research-support
- platform-sre
- process-auditor

Role mapping:

- `architect` -> `skills/shared/agents/tech-lead.md`
- `research-support` -> `skills/shared/agents/researcher.md`

The created agent must load its shared role file under `skills/shared/agents/` and the required source prompts under `prompts/`.

## Creation Rules

1. load the selected shared role file first
2. load the required source prompts
3. inject critical rules, responsibilities, required reading, and standard actions
4. do not create a generic fallback role for a gated delivery responsibility
5. do not enable `research-support` by default unless the task actually requires research work
